I highlighted code segments in the repositories: [Google App Script Unblocker](https://github.com/NathanDonagi/Google-App-Script-Unblocker), [Roomba Discord Bot](https://github.com/NathanDonagi/Roomba-Discord-Bot), and [Analytical Balance](https://github.com/NathanDonagi/Analytical-Balance). The highlighted code segment and its accompanying explanation is found in each repository's readme file.

The repositories for the other two projects shown in the video can be found at: [A Trot Through Time](https://github.com/NathanDonagi/A-Trot-Through-Time) and [Itsy Bitsy Robot](https://github.com/NathanDonagi/Itsy-Bitsy-Robot).

These projects appear in my video in the order: [Google App Script Unblocker](https://github.com/NathanDonagi/Google-App-Script-Unblocker), [Roomba Discord Bot](https://github.com/NathanDonagi/Roomba-Discord-Bot), [A Trot Through Time](https://github.com/NathanDonagi/A-Trot-Through-Time), [Analytical Balance](https://github.com/NathanDonagi/Analytical-Balance), [Itsy Bitsy Robot](https://github.com/NathanDonagi/Itsy-Bitsy-Robot).
